# Simulink-Circuits

Circuits modelled for simulation/verification after Linear Circuits Winter 2022 Assignments and Labs.

WARNINGS: Some circuits have the wrong polarity for sensors or elements, and some circuits are packed with unnecessary parts.

Again, I just modelled the circuits given on the schematics, for my sanity check and anyone else that wants to make sure their work is correct. The actual design of the circuits came from the textbook.

# Simulink-Circuits

Circuits modelled for simulation/verification after NE140 Winter 2022 Assignments and Labs.

WARNINGS: Some circuits have the wrong polarity for sensors or elements, and some circuits are packed with unnecessary parts.

Again, none of this is mine, I just modelled the circuits given on the schematics, for my sanity check and anyone else that wants to make sure their work is correct.
